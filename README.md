# The Corpus of Singapore English Messages (CoSEM)

![](https://github.com/wdwgonzales/CoSEM/blob/main/logo.png)


### Overview
The Corpus of Singapore English Messages (CoSEM) is a monitor corpus of online text messages collected between 2016 and 2022, compiled and managed by a group of scholars who share an interest in Colloquial Singapore English (CSE) research.
<br />

#### Features
- Contains the following metadata (as reflected in tags)
	- age
	- gender
	- race
	- nationality
	- year of collection
	- year of utterance
- in hierarchical text format: primed for concordance software including AntConc, CasualConc
<br />
<br />

### Disclaimer
The public version of the CoSEM (see 'Corpus Version' below) is a "sample" version with limitations. For example, based on our initial assessment, the scrubber does its work for the most part. However, we note that it scrubs non-name information that might be important for analyses. For example, (a) below becomes (b). Furthermore, we observed that it only scrubs information from the [`scrubadub`](https://scrubadub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ "scrubadub") package. As such, we recommend that you exercise caution in using the public version of the corpus. We put forward our intention of contributing to the scholarly community by showing whatever we can at this time. We thank you for your patience.

(a) <COSEM:18MF02-9431-23CHF-2014> Why u still dunwan go homr
(b) <COSEM:18MF02-9431-23CHF-2014> Why u still {{NAME}} go {{NAME}}

### Overview


#### Collection methodology

Please check out [our overview paper](https://github.com/wdwgonzales/CoSEM/tree/main/Overview%20paper).
<br />
<br />


#### Personal Data Scrubbing
We used the [`scrubadub`](https://scrubadub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ "scrubadub") package to scrub the public version of the corpus.

<br />


#### Corpus metadata or tag format
Every line of utterance has been tagged with an identifier tag. The tag format allows for easy identification of a line of utterance within the corpus, and for easy interpretation of relevant metadata. For example, the tag < 17CF15-40341-20CHF-2016 > shows that the utterance was collected in the year 2017 by a Chinese female with identification number 15; the utterance is line 40341 in the corpus; and the line was produced by a 20-year-old Chinese Singaporean female in 2016.

<br />
<br />

#### Corpus Version
The current version stands at 6.9 million words (as of November 2, 2022); however, the version released to the public - fully anonymized using the [`scrubadub`](https://scrubadub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ "scrubadub") package - is roughly 2 million words. We hope to release the scrubbed corpus incrementally over the next few years.

### Overview paper
We have published a paper that explains the motivations behind developing a new corpus for the investigation of CSE in 2021. It documents the process of compiling and organizing CoSEM and describes the corpusâ€™s initial structure and composition. We further discuss the social variables used in tagging the data, as well as ethical challenges, advantages, and disadvantages unique to online message datasets. In addition, we present preliminary analyses of two selected CSE features: (1) the Hokkien-derived expression (bo)jio and (2) sentence-final adverbs (already, also, only). We concluded the article with notes on future directions.
